Go, also called Golang or Go language
, is an open source programming 
language that Google developed. Software developers 
use Go in an array of operating systems and frameworks 
to develop web applications, cloud and networking services,
 and other types of software.Go is statically typed, explicit 
 and modeled after the C programming language. Because of Go 
 language's fast startup time, low runtime overhead and ability 
 to run without a virtual machine (VM), it has become a very popular 
 language for writing microservices and other uses. In addition,
  Go is used for concurrent programming -- 
  a strategy to execute multiple tasks at one time, 
  out of order or in partial order.
